
// Here are two difficult-level questions that push the boundaries of data manipulation and logic in JavaScript:

// Question 1: Dynamic Bonus Calculation and Custom Performance Evaluation
// Task: Given an array of student objects where each student has a name, marks (array of objects with subjects, scores, and difficulty level of the subject), and attendance (object with days present, total days, and a boolean field showing if the student was part of any extracurricular activities), create a new array of student objects using map() that includes:

// The student's name
// Final marks, calculated by:
// Adding 5 bonus points for each subject where the score is above 90.
// Multiplying the score by 1.2 if the subject's difficulty level is "hard."
// A custom "performanceEvaluation" based on:
// Scores in "hard" subjects contributing more weight:
// "Outstanding" if the average score across hard subjects is above 85 and overall average is above 80.
// "Satisfactory" if the overall average is above 70 but the hard subjects are below 85.
// "Needs Improvement" otherwise.
// Constraints: The evaluation and final marks must account for subject difficulty and the studentâ€™s participation in extracurricular activities.
